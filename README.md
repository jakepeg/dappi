Introducing dAppiDiary: The Ultimate Homework Companion.

dAppiDiary an MVP school homework diary for primary (elementary) school kids that was built as my dApp competition submission for the 2023 Motoko Bootcamp.

This version is a demo and currently doesn't have the ability to have multiple school / classes.

There is a parent and child mobile first diary app, and a teacher dashboard. The diary displays the homework set for the current week, which is updated at the end of the previous week. Parents mark homework as complete. The plan is to add dAppiCoins, where the children can earn coins for completing homework and can battle against their friends to earn the most.

As a parent I think decentralized childrenâ€™s data is a no brainer and one of the best use cases for web3, kids are the future as is blockchain where people can own their own data.

If anyone is a parent with kids at primary (elementary) school and wants to help with testing then please get in touch, I have other web3 projects for families on the go.
